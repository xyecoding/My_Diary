# The Attitude About Jobs <font color=magenta>[2022-06-09]</font>

## Jobs for Society (The Point is Optimum)

Society provides jobs that can make itself better and it also provides people in
the society to do these jobs.

It is a shame when somebody can not realize himself and do not good at something
in the society. However, people has different experience and environment. The
experience and environment will decide one to get some jobs but never the other
jobs.

Everyone has his advantage and disadvantage. Somebody can not realize himself in
somewhere, but realize himself in other places. People should find the optimal
way for himself and just.

## Jobs for Candidates (The Point is Initiative)

You should think for your personality, experience, and environment what job is
suitable for you. There is a lot of jobs in the society. They are all
meaningful. There must be a job for you. You choose your job.

Jobs is what do you want to do for the society and at the same time feeding
yourself. Everyone gets his job. People find the job suitable for him according
to his ability, personality and plan about his life. It should be totally free
for everyone.

When you feel not happy or shame when you do things related to the job. Maybe
just it does not suitable for you. Never mind and find the job you are happy
with.

You will feel shame, when you apply for a job as a lawyer, however, you only
study computer science.

I never know how people can do good things, when they always work and do not
have time to think.
