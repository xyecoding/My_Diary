# What is Learning

When I think about the knowledge I learned in the high school or the knowledge I
use everyday, I feel it is so easy. However, new things always difficult to be
learned.

Are the new things really difficult than the things I learned before? Not
really. The new things is difficult, just because I do not familiar with it.
Thus, I think learning something is just familiar with something. You get
familiar with something then you learned it.

From this opinion, it is so important to spend time on learning. Only if you
spend enough time, you will get familiar with it. Also, do not be afraid of
anything you want to learn, because you only need to familiar with it.
