# 7 Things for Data Science

1. basic programming language
2. statistic
3. machine learning
4. data wrangling
5. data visualization
6. software engineering
7. product management

For creating efficient algorithms for machine learning, I think the coding
ability is important. To improve the coding ability a proficient coding tool
must be needed like vim.

1. By be up on an excellent tool, we know how programmings and software are
   developed.
2. We will be both fast to write our own program and read excellent codes.

## Basic Programming Languages

You should know statistical programming language, like R or Python along with
numpy and pandas libraries, and a database querying language like SQL.

## Statistics

You should be able to explain phrases like null hypothesis, P-value, maximum
likelihood estimators and confidence intervals.

Statistics is important to crunch data and to pick out the most important
figures out of a huge dataset.

This is critical in the decision-making process and to design experiments.

## Machine Learning

You should know machine learning algorithms. These techniques typically are
implemented in R or Python. These algorithms show to employers that you have
exposure to how data science an be used in more practical manners.

## Data Wrangling

You should be able to clean up data. It is all about identifying corrupt (or
impure) data and correcting/deleting them.

## Data Visualization

Data scientist is useless on his own. They need to communicate their findings to
Product Managers in order to make sure those data are manifesting into real
applications. Thus, familiarity with data visualization tools like ggplot is
important (So you can SHOW the data, not just TALK ABOUT them).

## Software Engineering

You should know algorithms and data structures, as they are ofthen necessary in
creating efficient algorithms for machine learning. Know the use cases and run
time of these data structures: Queues, Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc.

## Product Management

This is definitely debatable, but those who understand the product are the noes
who will know what metrics are the most important. These are tons of numbers one
can A/B test, so product-oriented data scientist will pick the right metrics to
experiments with.
