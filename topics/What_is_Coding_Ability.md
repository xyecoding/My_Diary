# What is coding ability? <font color=magenta>[2022-05-15]</font>

I studied several language these days? However, I do not think my coding ability
is improved much. So what is coding ability? This question is important. It is
related to how to improve myself on coding.

## Execute Effectively

1. Algorithm; Good algorithm is definitely a criterion of good code. Good
   algorithm means the code will be executed fast. <span id = "al"></span>
2. Hardware Expressively; A good code must expresses the hardware and takes the
   full advantage of the hardware.

## Logic Completely

1. Overall Consideration; A good code must considers the situation
   comprehensively including possible error handing.

## Easy Going to People

1. The program is better to be modularized. Makes the local of your programs
   clear to people.<span id = "mo"></span>
2. Effective Comment Information; The comments do not need to be too much, but
   need to be effective. Comment when necessary in the important part of your
   code.
3. Sufficient Debug Information; A good code must has sufficient debug
   information. When an error occur or some important part is executed, it need
   to have sufficient debug or log information, which makes the executing detail
   of the program be learned.

## How To Do?

Thus, there is no need to lean many languages. The most important for me now may
be the logic of code including the global logic, i.e., [algorithm](#al) and
[modularized](#mo). Notice the <font color=red>global logic and the local
logic</font>.
